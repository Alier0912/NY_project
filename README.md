ANALYSIS PROCESS & FINDINGS 
Data Gathering- our data source was from Kaggle updated_air_quality_data ,we began by familiarizing ourselves  with the raw data (9 columns & 18017 rows )

* I found some incosistency with the data (unknown and other) , I hide them to make the data more precise and accurate
 
b) Data Cleaning & Transformation 
 I used primarily the power query to aid on the transformation processes , the date column was transformed into the year.

* I duplicated the original data to make new columns for relationship for the data to be used in the pivot table analysis
 
c) Data Visualization

* The answers to our questions are being answered in the dashboards above
 
d) RECOMMENDED ACTIONS

1)A thorough work of maintaining in Queens and during the Summer time to keep the air quality good, regulating the industries/businesses in Queens and during 
   the summer 
   
2) Since 2020 t0 2022 the value was dropping, the policies that led to this downward trajectory , must be held for good air quality in NY
 
3) Employing of modern technology especially cars  as they contribute making air quality bad; selling of electric or fuel efficient cars can reduce
    pollution in areas like Queens and New York generally.
